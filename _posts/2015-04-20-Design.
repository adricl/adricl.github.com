#### Trials and Tribulations 

From the image above you can see 6 different iterations of this quadcopter design. 
From the top left to the bottom right you can see the change in materials and design modifications. 

This is by no means a comprehensive list of different iterations. This is just what I found lying around that I had built with. The following are some of the design considerations. Please note I am not a mechanical or civil engineer. 

### Materials
I have been experimenting with many different materials, my primary concerns are weight, flexibility/rigidity and strength. 

At first I experimented with Acrylic at first which is really easy to lasercut and I have easy access to a laser cutter so this was the best material to prototype with. Acrylic is quite expensive compared with other materials such as Polycarbonate or plywood but my main issue was it was so brittle. I have had many light crashes where the frame just snapped in two. This not being my first quad, I am very used to crashes and having them break but these frames need to be more resilient, this was unacceptable. ******IMAGE 

I next tried polycarbonate, polycarbonate is the material used in bulletproof glass. It is heavier than acrylic and also surprisingly flexible I could bend it back on itself @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@PIC@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ This material also had to be watercut as lasercutting caused all sorts of toxic fumes to come out, and this process is so much more costly. 

In my search I started to look at wood again. I first had started on marine ply which is very toxic to lasercut but redly available. I came across bamboo ply which fulfills most of my criteria. Its very light and cheap and quite strong. 

## Weight

Weight is the most crucial as it effect everything in terms of flight. Too heavy and it wont be able to take off or reduce your flight time significantly. This will also effect the flight characteristics of the quadcopter. 

Acrylic is quite light and a very easily cut and manipulated. Its a great material to prototype and play with.

Polycarbonate is slightly heavier when compared to other materials of the same dimensions.

## Flexibility/Rigidity 

Flexibility is important in quadcopter design because it need to be able to absorb impact. Impacts happen all the time and can be mitigated by good landing legs, but this is also a large part of the design of the frame as well. Flex also impacts how sturdy the frame is. If it was too flexible it would impact the 

Acrylic was a good example of this, every time I landed even lightly it would crack or shatter the frame. This could not be mitigated by legs because the material was just too brittle and did not have enough flex. Acrylic also cracks easily  

Pollycarbonate on the other hand was too flexible as this image shows @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@***PIC  I had to layer this with Acrylc to get enough strength for this frame not to flex too much in flight. 

## Strength




### Design Issues 

--Issues with cracking and spliting due to holes and cracking due to acylcy

--Making tihicker area around holes

--rounded eddges for coners as they are a point of snapping. 

--shrinking the arms so to increase of coverage of air flow.

--working the materials short falls.

--Wire routing
